# CarND-Controls-MPCSelf-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program---This Project is done to implement a Model Predictive Control for the Udacity car running on the simulator. The Model is an approximation of the physics behind the actual car. This approximation predicts the trajectory of motion during each step and there by taking correct action based on the prediction. ###The Model:The model takes into consider 6 states them being the position (x,y), the orientation, velocity, the cross track error and the error in orientation. The two actuators we are controlling are the steer value and the throttle. The update equations are based on a simple vehicle model.### Time step and Elapsed time:The final value for N and dt that I have considered are 10 and 0.1. I also tried to run the simulator for value 20 and 0.05 and 10, 0.05. I found the pair (10,0.1) to run smoothly on my system and therefore selected it as my final value.### Polynomial fitting:I haven't done any preprocessing for polynomial fitting. However, before passing the values of state I have taken the latency into account and have passed the states accordingly. The states were figured out by considering the angle hasn't changed. ### Dealing with Latency:I have considered the movement of the car during the latency period and have updated my state with the new value. Therefore, when MPC calculates it uses the values with the updated position based on Latency. ## Basic Instructions:---### Dependencies* cmake >= 3.5 * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)* make >= 4.1(mac, linux), 3.81(Windows)  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)* gcc/g++ >= 5.4  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools]((https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)* [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets)  * Run either `install-mac.sh` or `install-ubuntu.sh`.  * If you install from source, checkout to commit `e94b6e1`, i.e.    ```    git clone https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets    cd uWebSockets    git checkout e94b6e1    ```    Some function signatures have changed in v0.14.x.
